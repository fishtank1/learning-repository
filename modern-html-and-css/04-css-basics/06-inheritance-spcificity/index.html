    <!-- Specificity is an algorithm that calculates the weight that is applied to a given CSS declaration.
    Order of specificity:
    ! -> Highest specificity -> Don't use this, use in debugging but not in implementing a style
    1. Inline CSS
    2. ID
    3. class
    4. element 

    If there is same declaration in file then the most recent declaration gets the highest specificity.
